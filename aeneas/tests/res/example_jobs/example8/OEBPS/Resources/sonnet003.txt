f000002|From fairest creatures we desire increase,
f000003|That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
f000004|But as the riper should by time decease,
f000005|His tender heir might bear his memory:
f000006|But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,
f000007|Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,
f000008|Making a famine where abundance lies,
f000009|Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:
f000010|Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,
f000011|And only herald to the gaudy spring,
f000012|Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
f000013|And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:
f000014|Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
f000015|To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.
