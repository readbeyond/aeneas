## Goal

**aeneas** automatically generates a **synchronization map**
between a list of text fragments
and an audio file containing the narration of the text.
In computer science this task is known as
(automatically computing a) **forced alignment**.

For example, given [this text file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/readbeyond/aeneas/master/aeneas/tests/res/container/job/assets/p001.xhtml)
and [this audio file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/readbeyond/aeneas/master/aeneas/tests/res/container/job/assets/p001.mp3),
**aeneas** determines, for each fragment, the corresponding time interval in the audio file:

```
1                                                     => [00:00:00.000, 00:00:02.680]
From fairest creatures we desire increase,            => [00:00:02.680, 00:00:05.480]
That thereby beauty's rose might never die,           => [00:00:05.480, 00:00:08.640]
But as the riper should by time decease,              => [00:00:08.640, 00:00:11.960]
His tender heir might bear his memory:                => [00:00:11.960, 00:00:15.280]
But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,         => [00:00:15.280, 00:00:18.520]
Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel, => [00:00:18.520, 00:00:22.760]
Making a famine where abundance lies,                 => [00:00:22.760, 00:00:25.720]
Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:        => [00:00:25.720, 00:00:31.240]
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,         => [00:00:31.240, 00:00:34.280]
And only herald to the gaudy spring,                  => [00:00:34.280, 00:00:36.960]
Within thine own bud buriest thy content,             => [00:00:36.960, 00:00:40.640]
And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:          => [00:00:40.640, 00:00:43.600]
Pity the world, or else this glutton be,              => [00:00:43.600, 00:00:48.000]
To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.        => [00:00:48.000, 00:00:53.280]
```

This synchronization map can be output to file in several formats:
EAF for research purposes,
SMIL for EPUB 3,
SBV/SRT/SUB/TTML/VTT for closed captioning,
JSON for Web usage,
or raw AUD/CSV/SSV/TSV/TXT/XML for further processing.


## System Requirements, Supported Platforms and Installation

### System Requirements

1. a reasonably recent machine (recommended 4 GB RAM, 2 GHz 64bit CPU)
2. [Python](https://python.org/) 2.7 (Linux, OS X, Windows) or 3.4 or later (Linux, OS X)
3. [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)
4. [eSpeak](http://espeak.sourceforge.net/)
5. Python modules `BeautifulSoup4`, `lxml`, and `numpy`
6. Python C headers to compile the Python C extensions (Optional but strongly recommended)
7. A shell supporting UTF-8 (Optional but strongly recommended)

### Supported Platforms

**aeneas** has been developed and tested on **Debian 64bit**,
which is the **only supported OS** at the moment.

However, **aeneas** has been confirmed to work on
other Linux distributions, OS X, and Windows.
See the [PLATFORMS file](https://github.com/readbeyond/aeneas/blob/master/wiki/PLATFORMS.md) for the details.

If installing **aeneas** natively on your OS proves difficult,
you are strongly encouraged to use
[aeneas-vagrant](https://github.com/readbeyond/aeneas-vagrant),
which provides **aeneas** inside a virtualized Debian image
running under [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
and [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/), which can be installed
on any modern OS (Linux, Mac OS X, Windows).

### Installation

1. Install [Python](https://python.org/) (2.7.x preferred),
   [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/), and
   [eSpeak](http://espeak.sourceforge.net/)

2. Make sure the following executables can be called from your shell:
   `espeak`, `ffmpeg`, `ffprobe`, `pip`, and `python`

3. First install `numpy` with `pip` and then `aeneas`:
    
    ```bash
    pip install numpy
    pip install aeneas
    ```

See the [INSTALL file](https://github.com/readbeyond/aeneas/blob/master/wiki/INSTALL.md)
for detailed, step-by-step procedures for Linux, OS X, and Windows.


## Usage

1. To check that you installed `aeneas` correctly, run:

   ```bash
    python -m aeneas.diagnostics
    ```

2. Run `execute_task` or `execute_job`
   with `-h` (resp., `--help`) to get a short (resp., long) usage message:

    ```bash
    python -m aeneas.tools.execute_task -h
    python -m aeneas.tools.execute_job -h
    ```

    The above commands also print a list of live usage examples
    that you can immediately run on your machine,
    thanks to the included example files.

3. To compute a synchronization map `map.json` for a pair
   (`audio.mp3`, `text.txt` in [plain](http://www.readbeyond.it/aeneas/docs/textfile.html#aeneas.textfile.TextFileFormat.PLAIN) text format), you can run:

    ```bash
    python -m aeneas.tools.execute_task \
        audio.mp3 \
        text.txt \
        "task_language=eng|os_task_file_format=json|is_text_type=plain" \
        map.json
    ```

   To compute a synchronization map `map.smil` for a pair
   (`audio.mp3`, [page.xhtml](http://www.readbeyond.it/aeneas/docs/textfile.html#aeneas.textfile.TextFileFormat.UNPARSED) containing fragments marked by `id` attributes like `f001`),
   you can run:

    ```bash
    python -m aeneas.tools.execute_task \
        audio.mp3 \
        page.xhtml \
        "task_language=eng|os_task_file_format=smil|os_task_file_smil_audio_ref=audio.mp3|os_task_file_smil_page_ref=page.xhtml|is_text_type=unparsed|is_text_unparsed_id_regex=f[0-9]+|is_text_unparsed_id_sort=numeric" \
        map.smil
    ```

   The third parameter (the _configuration string_) can specify several other parameters/options.
   See the [documentation](http://www.readbeyond.it/aeneas/docs/) for details.

4. If you have several tasks to process,
   you can create a job container and a configuration file,
   to process them all at once:

    ```bash
    python -m aeneas.tools.execute_job job.zip output_directory
    ```
    
   File `job.zip` should contain a `config.txt` or `config.xml`
   configuration file, providing **aeneas**
   with all the information needed to parse the input assets
   and format the output sync map files.
   See the [documentation](http://www.readbeyond.it/aeneas/docs/) for details.

The [documentation](http://www.readbeyond.it/aeneas/docs/)
provides an introduction to the concepts of
[Task](http://www.readbeyond.it/aeneas/docs/#tasks) and
[Job](http://www.readbeyond.it/aeneas/docs/#job),
and it lists of all the options and tools available in the library.

* Ability to use custom TTS engine wrapper besides the built-in ones
* Ability to download the audio from a YouTube video
* In multilevel mode, recursive alignment from paragraph to sentence to word level

* Automated detection of audio head/tail
* Output an HTML file for fine tuning the sync map manually (`finetuneas` project)
* Execution parameters tunable at runtime
* Code suitable for a Web app deployment (e.g., on-demand AWS instances)


## Limitations and Missing Features 

* Audio should match the text: large portions of spurious text or audio might produce a wrong sync map
* Audio is assumed to be spoken: not suitable/YMMV for song captioning
* No protection against memory trashing if you feed extremely long audio files
* On Mac OS X and Windows, audio synthesis might be slow if you have thousands of text fragments

If you are able to contribute code directly, that is awesome!
I will be glad to merge it!
Just a few rules, to make life easier for both you and me:

1. Please do not work on the `master` branch.
   Instead, create a new branch on your GitHub repo
   by cheking out the `devel` branch.
   Open a pull request from your branch on your repo
   to the `devel` branch on this GitHub repo.

2. Please make your code consistent with
   the existing code base style
   (see the
   [Google Python Style Guide](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html)
   ), and test your contributed code
   against the unit tests
   before opening the pull request.

3. Ideally, add some unit tests for the code you are submitting,
   either adding them to the existing unit tests or creating a new file
   in `aeneas/tests/`.

4. **Please note that, by opening a pull request,
   you automatically agree to apply
   the AGPL v3 license
   to the code you contribute.**
