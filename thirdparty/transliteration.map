# PROCESSING RULES
# 1. The file must be encoded using UTF-8.
# 2. The line terminator is parsed in universal mode (i.e., CR, LF, and CRLF are equivalent).
# 3. Each line contains at most one processing rule.
# 4. Each line is stripped before processing, that is, leading and trailing blank characters (spaces, tabs, etc.) are removed.
# 5. If a line is empty or it starts with '#', it is ignored. (Use '#' for comments.)
# 6. If a line contains only a group, it is treated as a "delete" rule.
# 7. If a line contains two groups, it is treated as a "replace" rule.
# 8. A group is:
#   a. a Unicode character (i.e., its actual bytes: 'à'); or
#   b. an ASCII string starting with "U+" and denoting the Unicode code point in hexadecimal (e.g., "U+12AB"); or
#   c. a range in the form "start-end", where "start" and "end" are as point a. or point b. (e.g., "a-z", "à-è", "U+2000-U+200D").
# 9. The group separator is the tab character or the space character (tab characters are automatically replaced by a space character).
# 10. Rules are processed from top to bottom, possibly overriding previous rules concerning the same character.
#
# NOTE
# Since the following characters have special meaning, you might need to use the U+.... syntax if they have to appear on a rule
# '\t' = U+9  (TAB)
# '\n' = U+A  (LF)
# '\r' = U+D  (CR)
# ' '  = U+20 (SPACE)
# '+'  = U+2B (PLUS SIGN)
# '-'  = U+2D (HYPHEN-MINUS)
# 'U'  = U+55 (CAPITAL LETTER U)
#
# EXAMPLES
# (Remove the leading "# " to make the rule effective)
# 
# Delete all 'à' characters
# à
#
# Delete all U+200A characters
# U+200A
#
# Delete all characters from 'à' to 'è' (included)
# à-è
#
# Delete all characters from U+2000 to U+200D (included)
# U+2000-U+200D
#
# Replace all 'à' characters with 'a'
# à a
#
# Replace all U+2010 characters with '-'
# U+2010 -
#
# Replace all characters from U+2010 to U+2016 (included) with '-'
# U+2010-U+2016 -
#
# Replace all 'ñ' characters with 'ny' (note that the replacement has more than one character)
# ñ ny
#
# Same as above, but using the U+.... syntax (note you can chain U+.... strings)
# U+F1 U+6EU+67
#
# After these two rules, 'b' characters will be replaced by '2' (the second rule will override the first)
# a-z 1
# b 2
